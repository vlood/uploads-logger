Log user-uploaded files for future reference by a shortcode.

== Description ==
The plugin logs info on when a user uploaded a file. Info is saved as usermeta entry, containing file-name and timestamp of the event. The entry is actually an array of all upload log entries of the user. Using the shortcode [my-uploads-log], you will get a list of current user\'s uploads that have been logged.
